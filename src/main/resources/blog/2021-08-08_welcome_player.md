# Welcome Player

That is just the beginning.
Welcome to the game.

Do you want to know how it works?
No problem. 
We will publish more blogposts during
the following days with the instructions
and new functionalities.

## Entering the game

Now it is more easy than ever to start a game:
- there are no passwords
- no signups
- no game creators
Just write your player name and start (or continue) playing.

### All it's in the browser

You are reading this blogpost, so you already
know where the game is. Yes, in your browser.

### Welcome

You start in the welcome screen, just a fine welcoming message.

 * You should be at the "welcome" screen.

### Enter with a player

At the top right there is an input box for the next player to play. Fill and go:

 * Enter "leonard" as player name.
 * Click the play button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the "game" screen.
 * "leonard" should be the current player.

And you can click play again if you want.

 * Click the play button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the "game" screen.
 * "leonard" should be the current player.

Or you can change the player so you have another player playing.

 * Enter "penny" as player name.
 * Click the play button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the "game" screen.
 * "penny" should be the current player.

### Shorting

From now, it will be more easy to change player, just with:

 * Go to the next player "leonard"
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the "game" screen.
 * "leonard" should be the current player.

 * Go to the next player "penny"
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the "game" screen.
 * "penny" should be the current player.
