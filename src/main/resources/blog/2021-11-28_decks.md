# Decks

We add decks to our ships.
They are like buildings but for ship.
These decks will allow lots of new functionalities,
like new type of resources, to many other things.

## Decks, decks, decks

### Deck builder

All the ships starts with a new special deck,
the deck builder. This deck allow us to add
many more decks.

 * Go to the next player "leonard"
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * Go to the "leonard" "ship" "Beagle"
 * You should be at the screen of a "ship".
 * There should contain at least 1 "deck".
 * There should contain the "deck" "Builder".
 
### Gold store

Ships cannot transport gold, unless, there is a gold deck. You can build
a gold store spending 5 of steel.

 * Given that the "leonard" "city" "Capital" has resource "steel" count 5.
 * Given that the "leonard" "city" "Capital" has resource "gold" count 6.
 * The resource "gold" maximum should be 0.
 * Go to the contained "deck" "Builder".
 * Build the "Gold store".
