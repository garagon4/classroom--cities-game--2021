# Ships

Imagine a city in front of the sea,
with a nice ship docked.

Will you board? 

## Your ships      

### One ship

All players start with one ship:

 * Go to the next player "leonard"
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * "leonard" should have 1 "ship".
 * "leonard" should have the "Beagle" "ship"
 * Go to the "leonard" "ship" "Beagle".
 * You should be at the "entity" screen.
 * You should be at the screen of a "ship".
 * The _name_ content should be "Beagle".
 * The _type_ content should be "ship".
 * The _owner_ content should be "leonard".

And you can see that the ship is docked the city:

 * It should be docked at the "leonard" "city" "Capital".
 * Go to see the dock.
 * You should be at the screen of a "city".
 * The _name_ content should be "Capital".
 * The _type_ content should be "city".
 * The _owner_ content should be "leonard".

And ships are also visible from the city:

 * There should be 1 docked "leonard" "ship".
 * There should be docked the "leonard" "Beagle" "ship".
 * Go to see the docked "leonard" "ship" "Beagle".
 * You should be at the screen of a "ship".
 * The _name_ content should be "Beagle".
 * The _type_ content should be "ship".
 * The _owner_ content should be "leonard".

### Changing Name

And, like cities, you can change the name of the ships.

 * Change the name to "Cerritos"
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * You should be at the screen of a "ship".
 * The _name_ content should be "Cerritos".

### Loading ships

You can transfer people from the city to the ship, and vice-versa:

 * You should be at the screen of a "ship".
 * The resource "population" count should be 0.
 * The dock resource "population" count should be 10.
 * Enter number 2 as _load unload amount_.
 * Load the resource "population".
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * You should be at the screen of a "ship".
 * The resource "population" count should be 2.
 * The dock resource "population" count should be 8.

But there is a maximum load.

 * The resource "population" maximum should be 5.
 * Enter number 999 as _load unload amount_.
 * Load the resource "population".
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * The resource "population" count should be 5.
 * The dock resource "population" count should be 5.

### Unloading ships

You can also unload ships.

 * Enter number 2 as _load unload amount_.
 * Unload the resource "population".
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * You should be at the screen of a "ship".
 * The resource "population" count should be 3.
 * The dock resource "population" count should be 7.

But you cannot unload pas the limit of the dock. 
So if we wait to achieve the maximum:

 * Skip 15 rounds.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * The game round should be 16.
 * You should be at the screen of a "ship".
 * The resource "population" count should be 3.
 * The dock resource "population" count should be 20.
 * The dock resource "population" maximum should be 20.

We will see that we cannot unload population:

 * Enter number 999 as _load unload amount_.
 * Unload the resource "population".
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * The resource "population" count should be 3.
 * The dock resource "population" count should be 20.

Nothing happened.
